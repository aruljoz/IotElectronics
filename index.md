This service supports the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics_full}} solution with user and device registration and notifications. It is a component of the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter and should not be deployed separately.
{:shortdesc}

Get started with IoT for Electronics by using the IoT for Electronics Starter app located in the Boilerplates section of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. See [Creating apps with the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter](../../starters/IotElectronics/iot4egettingstarted.html).

**Important:** If you deployed this service as part of the Starter, go to the Starter application to use the features of the solution. If you deployed this service by itself, delete this instance and deploy the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter instead.
