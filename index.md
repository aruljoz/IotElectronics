# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}}
{: #gettingstartediote}

This service supports the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics_full}} solution with user and device registration and notifications. It is a component of the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter and should not be deployed separately.
{:shortdesc}

Get started with {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter app located in the Boilerplates section of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. See [Creating apps with the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter](/docs/starters/IoTElectronics-starter/iot4egettingstarted.html).

**Important:** If you deployed this service as part of the Starter, go to the Starter application to use the features of the solution. If you deployed this service by itself, delete this instance and deploy the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} Starter instead.
